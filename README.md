# Iris flower species predictor

A project that predicts the species of an iris flower could be based on its physical measurments.

The programming language used is python v3.13.5.
This project uses linear regression from scikit-learn library and pandas library.

The model is trained from the famous Fisher's Iris dataset (1936).

Predictions are based on sepal length (cm), sepal width(cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm).

The model predicts a number corresponding to the species:
0: Iris Setosa
1: Iris Versicolor
2: Iris Verginica
Any other number: Unknown species

# To run the program
- This program requires python >= v3.13.5
- Installed libraries mentioned in requirements.txt file
- Run main.py
