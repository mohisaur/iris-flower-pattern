# Iris flower species predictor

A project that predicts the species of an iris flower could be based on its physical measurments.

The programming language used is python v3.13.5.
This project uses linear regression from scikit-learn library and pandas library.

The model is trained from the famous Fisher's Iris dataset (1936).

Predictions are based on sepal length (cm), sepal width(cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm).

The model predicts a number corresponding to the species:
0: Iris Setosa
1: Iris Versicolor
2: Iris Verginica
Any other number: Unknown species

# To run the program
Ensure you have the iris.csv file with the Iris dataset.  
Run the program: python iris_classifier.py.  
View the model's accuracy percentage.  
Enter flower measurements when prompted:  
- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width
